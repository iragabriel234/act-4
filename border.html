        <p class="p1">A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
I'm feelin' lonely (Lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

[Verse 2: Aran]
I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?</p>
